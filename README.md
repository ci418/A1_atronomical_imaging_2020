# A1_atronomical_imaging_2020
Contains code used for Imperial College Physics 3rd year labs experiment A1 'Astronomical imaging' on term 1 cycle 1 in 2020. 
Code produced by Charalambos Ioannou and Ines Belo Ferreira.

This repository should contain 5 Python scripts. These are

'Histogram' - Python script that produces the initial histogram of the data created to determine the background mean

'aperture_test' - Python script that tests the function of a square aperture on a simulated 2d Gaussian array

'Test_on_image' - Python script that tests our algorithm on a small part of the image

'Circular_aperture_test' - Python script that tests the creation of a circular aperture using artificial data
and also tests the circular aperture on a small part of the image (same part as in 'Test_on_image')

'Final_count' - Python script that runs the algorithm on the whole image and produces the catalogue. 
Also produces the plot of number of galaxies brighter than a brightness limit m against m
